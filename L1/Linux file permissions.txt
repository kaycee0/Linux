#There are new requirements to automate a backup process that was performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team earlier.
#To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers,
#however they did not make it executable on one the app server i.e App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

#Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Also make sure every user can execute it.

solution

ssh banner@stapp03
cd /tmp  ------ to navigate to the tmp directory
ls -l | grep 'xfusioncorp.sh' ------ to view permissions of the file xfusioncorp.sh
#or
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh  ------ to view permissions of the file xfusioncorp.sh
# Note: A script cannot be executable if it can't be read, so we make it readable first
sudo chmod +r xfusioncorp.sh  ----- making the file readable
sudo chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh  ----- making the file executable
