#On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading 
#the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:


#a. soft limit = 1024
#b. hard_limit = 2027

solution
ssh natasha@ststor01
cat /etc/passwd   ----- to print list of system accounts and information like user ID
sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf   ------  to view and make changes to the file using the vi editor
#add this below, to the end of the file
@nfsuser soft nproc 1024
@nfsuser hard nproc 2027
