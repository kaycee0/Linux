#On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred 
#of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its
#maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:

#a. soft limit = 1027
#b. hard_limit = 2027

solution

ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo cat /etc/passwd  ----- to print list of system accounts and information like user ID
sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf  ---- to view and make changes to the file using the vi editor
#Add this below, to the end of the file
#@nfsuser soft nporc 1024
#@nfsuser hard nporc 2027
