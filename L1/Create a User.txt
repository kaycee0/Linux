#For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted,
#rather than its default user. This will be the Apache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per 
#requirements given below:

#a. Create a user named yousuf on the App server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.
#b. Set its UID to 1189 and home directory to /var/www/yousuf.

#solution

 ssh banner@stapp03
 sudo useradd -u 1189 -d/var/www/yousuf yousuf    -----  -u 1189 for UID
                                                         -d for directory
