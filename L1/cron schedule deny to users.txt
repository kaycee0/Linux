#To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on 
#crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. Limit crontab access to below 
#specified users on App Server 1.

#Allow crontab access to javed user and deny the same to ryan user.

solution

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo vi /etc/cron.allow
#type in "javed"
sudo vi /etc/cron.deny
#type in "ryan"
