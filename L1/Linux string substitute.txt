#The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files used by the Nautilus application.
#However, these template XML files must be populated with valid data before they can be used. One of the
#daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp industries is to apply string and file manipulation
#commands!

#Replace all occurances of the string sample to torpedo on the XML file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.

solution

ssh clint@stbkp01
sudo sed -i 's/sample/torpedo/g' /root/nautilus.xml  ----replacing all occurrences of the string "sample" with "torpedo"
