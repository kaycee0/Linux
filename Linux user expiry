#A developer named jim has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project,
#we need a temporary user for jim. 
#Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

#Therefore, create a user named jim on the App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2021-12-07. Make sure the user is created 
#as per standard and is in lowercase.

solution

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo useradd -e 2021-12-07 jim    ----- to create a user jim with expiry date
