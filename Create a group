#There are specific access levels for users defined by the xFusionCorp Industries system admin team. Rather than providing access levels to 
#every individual user, the team has decided to create groups with required access levels and add users to that groups as needed. 
#See the following requirements:

#a. Create a group named nautilus_noc in all App servers in Stratos Datacenter.
#b. Add the user Jarod to nautilus_developers group in all App servers. (create the user if doesn't exist).

solution

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo groupadd nautilus_developers              ----- to create a group called nautilus_developers
Sudo useradd Jarod                             ------ to create a user called Jarod
Sudo usermod -a -G nautilus_developers Jarod   ------ to add a user Jarod to the group nautilus_developers

Repeat the steps for the other 2 AppServers
